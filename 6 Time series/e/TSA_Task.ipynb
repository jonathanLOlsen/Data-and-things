The tasks will help you develop essential skills in handling time-based data, including cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building. You'll explore techniques such as creating lag and rolling window features, implementing linear regression for time series prediction, and applying XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning. Finally, you'll evaluate and compare the performance of the models, providing insights into their effectiveness. These tasks will enhance your understanding of time series analysis and prepare you for real-world forecasting challenges."],"metadata":{"id":"3kQ3BvyLehMH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **About the Dataset**\n","The Bike Sharing Dataset contains information about bike rental counts in the city of Washington, D.C., recorded at hourly intervals. The dataset provides data on various factors that influence bike rentals, including weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal factors. It includes several features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and day of the week, which can be used for building predictive models to forecast bike rental demand.\n","\n","The dataset spans multiple years and captures the number of bikes rented at each hour of the day, making it ideal for time series analysis. By leveraging this data, you can explore patterns in bike rentals over time, uncover seasonality, and implement models for predicting future rental demand.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","## **Key Attributes in the Dataset:**\n","\n","**instant:** Record index.\n","\n","**dteday:** Date of the observation.\n","\n","**season:** The season (1: Spring, 2: Summer, 3: Fall, 4: Winter).\n","\n","**yr:** Year (0: 2011, 1: 2012).\n","\n","**mnth:** Month of the year (1 to 12).\n","\n","**hour:** Hour of the day (0 to 23).\n","\n","**holiday:** Whether the day is a holiday (1: Yes, 0: No).\n","\n","**weekday:** Day of the week (0 to 6).\n","\n","**workingday:** Whether it's a working day (1: Yes, 0: No).\n","\n","**weathersit:** Weather condition (1: Clear, 2: Mist, 3: Light Rain, 4: Heavy Rain).\n","\n","**temp:** Temperature (normalized).\n","\n","**hum:** Humidity (normalized).\n","\n","**windspeed:** Wind speed (normalized).\n","\n","**cnt:** The total number of bike rentals at that hour.\n","\n","This dataset offers a comprehensive set of features to explore and analyze bike-sharing patterns, making it an excellent resource for time series forecasting tasks."],"metadata":{"id":"-6dqpBX8eayc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Exercise**\n","\n","1. Load the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset) from Kaggle. Use the \"hour.csv\" file.\n","2.

Create the lag and rolling windows features for the \"cnt\" column such as: 1 day lag, 1 week lag, 1 month, etc. and last 3 day rolling mean, last 3 hours rolling mean, etc. But it should be based on your dataset and what makes sense for this dataset.\n","5. Implement linear regression to predict how many bikes will be rented each hour of the last week and evaluate using appropriate metrics.\n","6. Implement XGBoost to predict how many bikes will be rented each hour of the last week and evaluate using appropriate metrics.\n","7. Experiment with predicting different time periods, such as use all data to predict bike rentals for just the next day (24 hours) or the next entire month and then see how much better or worse the model gets\n","8. Experiment tuning hyperparameters\n","\n","**Bonus task (Optional)**\n","\n","This tasks is not mandatory, but it is designed for those who want to challenge themselves, enhance their critical thinking skills, or dive deeper into the topic.
