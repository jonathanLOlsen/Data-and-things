      "A: Deforestation is a significant threat to the Amazon, with thousands of square kilometers lost each year due to agriculture, logging, and urbanization. This deforestation contributes to climate change, as the rainforest acts as a major carbon sink, absorbing millions of tons of carbon dioxide annually. Indigenous tribes have lived in the Amazon for thousands of years, relying on its rich biodiversity for food, medicine, and shelter.\n",

    "the sliding window results indicate that while overlapping chunks can preserve context across sentence boundaries, they may sometimes include extra or even unrelated details. For instance, for the question “How does the Amazon rainforest affect global weather patterns?”, the retrieved chunk begins in one context (indigenous tribes) and then includes information about the rainforest’s role in weather. This happens because the sliding window (e.g., a window of 3 sentences with an overlap) captures multiple sentences at once, and if the window is too large or the step size is too small, you might end up with chunks that mix several topics.\n",

For example, when I asked \"What types of wildlife can be found in the Amazon?\" I got an answer about indigenous tribes. But when I rephrased it to \"Which animals and insects inhabit the Amazon rainforest?\" I got a response that listed jaguars, sloths, and insects. Basically, even small tweaks in the wording change the embedding the model uses, which then changes what text it finds most similar. This shows that rephrasing your question can help get a more accurate or relevant answer."
